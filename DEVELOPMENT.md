Using the 3D graphics library, I was able to load and display a sphere with the earth texture on top of it. The experience I had with working with this library was
hard at first, but I was able to understand how to build and display a 3D object. I mainly followed tutorials online, which helped simplify the process and
let me better understand the methods' and classes' functions.

Changed project from 3D to 2D (see PROPOSAL.md).
Created player class and .h files to represent the player's actions. Implemented movement commands for both players, and set the background of the game.
I figured out how to draw shapes and move them fluidly across the screen.

Short Term Goals:
Implement Resize method that works when player changes size of graphic interface.
Implement rocket firing, rocket reflecting, and ammo spawn.
Draw flat ship and implement system which prevents player from leaving the ship.

Problems:
How to read 2 inputs at the same time (2 keys cannot be pressed at the same time).
How to implement a ship that can be modified over time (create a new class?).
