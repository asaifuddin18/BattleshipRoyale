Using the 3D graphics library, I was able to load and display a sphere with the earth texture on top of it. The experience I had with working with this library was
hard at first, but I was able to understand how to build and display a 3D object. I mainly followed tutorials online, which helped simplify the process and
let me better understand the methods' and classes' functions.
